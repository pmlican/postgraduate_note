  Undoubtedly, the diagram demonstrates the social phenomenon of idol worship prevalent among the teenagers nowadays. Briefly speaking, young people are inclined to idolize the people who excel in appearance, intelligence or talent. For instance, Su Bingtian represents the image of a sports hero, whose handsome appearance and unparalleled skills are passionately adored by all the sports fans.By contrast, several teenage boys and girls win their fame overnight in a great many contests on TV, which provokes noisy nationwide debates on the value and harm of admiring these idols.
  In my opinion, idolatry, the thought-provoking social phenomenon, is a double-edged sword which can
exert profound influence for either good or bad on the growth of young people.
