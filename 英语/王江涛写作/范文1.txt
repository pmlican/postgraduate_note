  The chart above clearly demonstrates the total number of fans followers paying close attention to the Microblog of entertainment stars from 2017 to 2018. In 2017, the number was at a low level of merely about 12.8 billion, while within no more than one year, it reached 16.7 billion, a rise of 3.9 billion.
  Undoubtedly, the diagram demonstrates the social phenomenon of idol worship prevalent among the teenagers nowadays. Briefly speaking, young people are inclined to idolize the people who excel in appearance, intelligence or talent. For instance, Su Bingtian represents the image of a sports hero, whose handsome appearance and unparalleled skills are passionately adored by all the sports fans.By contrast, several teenage boys and girls win their fame overnight in a great many contests on TV, which provokes noisy nationwide debates on the value and harm of admiring these idols.
  In my opinion, idolatry, the thought-provoking social phenomenon, is a double-edged sword which can exert profound influence for either good or bad on the growth of young people. If we simply worship idols by imitating their hairstyle or pursuing fashions unreasonably, the obsession will certainly waste a great deal of our time and money, endangering the efficiency of our study or work.On the contrary, if we endeavor to improve ourselves by bridging the gap between our models and us, we will lead a positive and fruitful life.
