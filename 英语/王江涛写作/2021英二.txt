居民锻炼方式占比：
1. 虽然是柱状图，但其数据为百分比，所以要分析数据占比
2. 多用同义词替换，比如主题是锻炼，因为出现次数较多，所以要适当的替换下

  According to the chart, over half of the respondents get physical exercise by themselves, while 47.7% do so with friends and 23.9% with family members. By comparison, no more than 16% of those questioned play team sports.
  People prefer to take exercise alone rather than with someone else primarily on account of flexibility and convenience. In this way, they can, for example, go jogging anytime they want, without the need to make a plan with friends in advance. Furthermore, a wide range of fitness videos, apps and games have boosted the popularity of doing workouts alone at home. Another conclusion from the data is that people are much more likely to work out with friends than with family members. That may be because exercise is not a part of the whole family's daily routine, or simply because they live apart from their family.
  Taking exercise alone will be a growing trend in today's busy society where most people's schedules do not match. But it is advisable, if possible, to find a workout partner to keep motivated.
